## Things to note

### Code Structure

The code is split into multiple files. However there are two main things you should note: **The Program files, and the Data files.**

**The Program files,** which are located in the client folder, are the files that handle the [front-end](github.com/Spec-ify/specify/blob/main/client/Program.cs), [settings](github.com/Spec-ify/specify/blob/main/client/Settings.cs), [json exporting and uploading](github.com/Spec-ify/specify/blob/main/client/Monolith.cs), while **the Data files** , in the Data folder, are the ones that actually perform the specs collection.

### Pull Requests
**Pull requests** should be in the format: 

`(category/ies of change): summary of change`

**For example:**
- (feature): add bad registry values from gesp ([#8](github.com/Spec-ify/specify/pull/8)) 
- (bugfix): filter appname nulls in installed apps ([#11](github.com/Spec-ify/specify/pull/11))
